== Course Info

**Welcome to CS283: Game Programming**! 

image::SnowCabin.png[]

This intermediate programming course covers the foundational concepts,
architectures, and mathematics underlying video games and digital interactive
experiences. We will deconstruct the designs of classic games, such as Pac-Man,
Super Mario Brothers, Minecraft, Doom, and Diablo II, to explore the data
structures, algorithms, and foundational mathematics necessary to implement
popular game mechanics and features. Potential topics will include rendering and
modeling, navigation systems, game artificial intelligence, dialog systems,
character animation, networked multiplayer, user interfaces, physics engines,
and sound. The course will challenge students to create original and novel game
concepts through weekly assignments, labs, and a final project. Through these
projects, students will learn the foundational mathematics behind "making
objects move", such as transformations, splines, collision detection, and
raycasting. Furthermore, students will gain object-oriented programming
experience through designing mid-scale programs. Programming and project
assignments will be in C#, use the Processing and Unity frameworks, and
cover how to build games for different platforms, namely web, desktop, virtual
reality, and augmented reality.
