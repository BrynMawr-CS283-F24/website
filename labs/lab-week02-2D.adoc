[discrete]
= Drawing 101

* Using link:https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp[an online color picker], find the HTML color string that corresponds to red , e.g. (255, 0, 0)

{nbsp} +

* In a RGBA color, what does each component represent? 

{nbsp} +

* Write a formula that converts from unsigned char color values (e.g. [0,255]) to float color values (e.g. [0,1]).

{nbsp} +

* Draw the coordinate system that extends from (0,0) to (500,500) and have axes matching the 
coordinate system in C#'s System.Drawing API. 
** Draw a circle with radius 50 at (100,400)
** Draw a rectangle with width 100 and height 200 at (250,250)

= Game Loop 

Consider the base code for link:../assts/asst02.html[assignment 2]. Code is link:https://github.com/BrynMawr-CS283-F24/cs283-f24-assignments/tree/main/C%23Game[here]. Suppose `Game.cs` looks like

```
using System;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Windows.Forms;

public class Game
{
   class Point {
      public float x;
      public float y;

      public Point(float a, float b) 
      {
         x = a;
         y = b;
      } 
      public void Update(float dt)
      {
         x += 100 * dt;
      }
   }
   Point _point = null; 

   public void Setup()
   {
      _point = new Point(25, (float) (Window.height * 0.5));
   }

   public void Update(float dt)
   {
      _point.Update(dt);
   }

   public void Draw(Graphics g)
   {
      Brush brush = new SolidBrush(Color.Red);
      g.FillEllipse(brush, _point.x, _point.y, 100, 100);
   }

   public void MouseClick(MouseEventArgs mouse) { }
   public void KeyDown(KeyEventArgs key) { }
}
```
