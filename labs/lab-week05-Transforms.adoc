= Transforms in Unity

Suppose we have placed a cube and a sphere in our scene hierarchy as follows

image::lab-week05-Transforms.png[]

Suppose the cube has the following values on its transform component

* translation: (2,0,0)
* rotation: (0, 0, 45)
* scale: (1,1,1)

Suppose the sphere has the following values on its transform component

* translation: (-2, 1, 0)
* rotation: (0,0,0)
* scale: (1,1,1)

What are the *local* coordinates of the sphere's position, up axis, and right axis?

Give the 4x4 matrix transform that corresponds to the transform component on the cube.

= Character Controls 

Before leaving lab today, implement the simple player controls from link:..\assts\asst05.html[Assignment 02] and 
answer the following questions.

Draw a picture that shows the coordinate axes of the root of your character and the coordinate axes of the camera.

On you picture, draw the following quantities.

* Draw the vector (characterPos - cameraPos)
* Draw the point p = 5 * characterUpVector + -3 characterRightVector 
* Draw the vector (p - cameraPos)

Answer the following questions from the assignment writeup

* How can we get the forward and up directions of a GameObject in Unity?

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

* How can we set parameters in a script so that we can give them values in the Unity IDE?
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

* How can we use tie to ensure the player moves smoothly?
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

* In Unity, how can you specify a rotation around the Y axis?
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

* When we translate the player we add a displacement. How do we "add", or concatenate, a rotation to the player?
