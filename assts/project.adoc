**Idea: Due Friday, Nov 22**
**Project: Due Friday, Dec 13**

The goals for this project are:

* Explore topics that are interesting to you
* Create a playable experience that you can share with others
* Expand on skills and knowledge learned during the semester
* Create a portfolio project 

:sectnums:

= Requirements

* Your project should create a piece of software, such as a demo, tool, or game
* Your project should be unique and represent your own creativity. It is ok to use assets made by other people so long as you attribute their work.

Your final grade will be based on

* Git repository - Your project should build and run in Unity, without modifications
* Your README should summarize your work from the semester using text, videos, gifs, and images
* Demonstrate effort and creativity. To earn an A, the final result must show quality, effort and ingenuity.

= Milestones

* Project idea: *Due Nov 22nd* (Informally, email or slack your idea to the instructor.)
* Playable project demo: Due Dec 10th.
* Final project submission: Due Dec 13th

= Project Idea

*Due Nov 22nd*

Email or slack your idea and title to anormoyle@brynmawr.edu.

Your project idea should include:

* Project title/idea
* How will this project be unique from existing demos? 
* Identify the features you plan to implement and a timeline for completing them

You will only have a three weeks to finish your project so try to scope the work appropriately. 
Below are some ideas:

* Extend your HelloUnity homework to include features to make it a polished, playable experience. For example, you might implement battle mechanics, story elements, a win condition, enhanced UI, and cut scenes.  
** Add an intro screen and/or animation
** Add story elements and lore
** Add characters that the player can talk to
** Add a battle system or other game mechanics
** Improve the user interface: add a map, feedback text, or menus
** Add inventory or crafting
* Implement a whole new game concept (Watch out that it is not too complex!)
* Implement a technical demo
** Implement your own A* and character steering algorithm
** Implement crowds or flocking
** Implement a town of agents with daily life activities
** Implement cloth simulation
** Implement a procedural city or level generator
** Implement a physically-based character or vehicle

== Demo Day

*Due Dec 10th*

You will need to have videos and a playable experience ready on Dec 10th. 
In class and lab, we view all videos and have a Q&A for each game, followed by an 
open play session where we will take turns trying each others' games.

== Final Submission

*Due Dec 13th*

If you are extending your assignments to create a stand alone game, your submission 
should do the following:

* implement your game in a scene, called `Project.unity`. 
* extend the readme to include
** Directions on how to play
** Directions on how to build and run in Unity
** Screenshots and videos of your game
** A list of the features you implemented for your game, with references to the scripts that implement these features
* You also MUST submit an executable for your game that runs on *Windows*
** Your executable should exit when the player presses the 'Escape' key
* You must also submit a 800x450 representative image for your game/demo that has the title and your name, institution, and graduation year.

For example, something like 

image::CursedAcorn-RepresentativeImage.png[width=800px]

If you are implementing a new game, you must email the instructor (anormoyle@brynmawr.edu) 
with a link to the repository with your new project. Your README.md should include 

* Directions on how to play
* Directions on how to build and run in Unity, particularly what scene to open
* Screenshots and videos of your game
* A list of the features you implemented for your game, with references to the scripts that implement these features
* You also MUST submit an executable for your game that runs on *Windows*
** Your executable should exit when the player presses the 'Escape' key
* You must also submit a 800x450 representative image for your game/demo that has the title and your name, institution, and graduation year.
