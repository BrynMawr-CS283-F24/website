**Due Sunday, October 20, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Implement path following based on a Bezier curve
* Implement a gaze controller for your character

:sectnums:

= Getting Started

It is not necessary to fetch from the upstream repository this week. Instead, 

* Create a new scene, called `A06_FollowPath`, and save it to your `HelloUnity/Assets/Scenes` folder.
* Create a new scene, called `A06_IK`, and save it to your `HelloUnity/Assets/Scenes` folder.

**Scene and Player Setup**

In both your scenes:

* Initialize your scene with the prefab containing your level from assignments 3 and 4
* Add your character from assignment 4. 

IMPORTANT: Make sure your character does not have any control or animation scripts on it for this assignment!

= Assignment Goals

This assignment has two parts. In the first, you will implement a demo where your character follows a 
Bezier curve specified with locators (e.g. empty GameObjects) in the scene. In the second, you will 
implement that allows you to pose your character using IK. 

== Path Following

You will write two scripts for this demo. Both scripts will need a list if locations that specify the 
path. I recommend that you re-use the method for storing POIs from assignment 4.  

=== Spline with degree-1 polynomial

* Write a script, `Scripts/FollowPathLinear.cs`, that is a component for the root of your player character.
* Using a *coroutine*, make your character follow the path using *lerp*. 
* The orientation of the character should match the forward direction of the curve.

In class, we covered how to use a coroutine to move between two locations using Lerp.

using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class LerpCoroutine : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform start;
    public Transform end;
    public float duration = 3.0F;
    float timer = 0;

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        StartCoroutine(DoLerp());
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Space))
        {
            StartCoroutine(DoLerp());
        }
    }

    IEnumerator DoLerp() 
    {
        for (float timer = 0; timer < duration; timer += Time.deltaTime) 
        {
            float u = timer / duration;
            transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(start.position, end.position, u);
            transform.rotation = Quaternion.Slerp(start.rotation, end.rotation, u);
            yield return null;
        }
    }
}

=== Spline with degree-3 polynomial

* Write a script, `Scripts/FollowPathCubic.cs`, that is a component for the root of your player character.
* Using a *coroutine*, make your character follow the path using a *cubic* Bezier curve. 
* The orientation of the character should match the forward direction of the curve.
* Add an option, 'DeCasteljau', which has a bool type. If true, use De Casteljau's algorithm to compute the cubic curve. If false, use the polynomial formula.

Unlike with a piecewise linear curve, a cubic Bezier curve needs 4 control points, where two points, b0 and b3, 
are the endpoints of the curve segment, and two points, b1 and b2, control the shape of the curve. 

[stem]
++++
p(t) = (1-t)^3 b_0 + 3t(1-t)^2 b_1 + 3t^2(1-t) b_2 + t^3 b_3
++++

In class, we also talked about how we can make the curve smooth between segments
if we position b1 and b2 so the slopes match.  Use the following formulas to set
the control points b0, b1, b2, and b3, where stem:[p_{i-1}, p_{i}] are the endpoints 
of the curve segment.

[stem]
++++
b_0 = p_{i-1}

b_1 = b_0 + (1/6) * (p_{i} - p_{i-2}) 

b_2 = b_3 - (1/6) * (p_{i+1}- p_{i-1}) 

b_3 = p_{i}
++++

If you are computing b1 for the first segment, use the following formula

[stem]
++++
b_1 = b0 + (1/6) * (b3 - b0) \quad \text{if first segment} 
++++

If you are computing b2 for the last segment, use the following formula

[stem]
++++
b2 = b3 - (1/6) * (b3 - b0) \quad \text{if last segment} 
++++

You might find it useful to visualize the Bezier curve. To do this, you can sample the points along the curve  and then draw it 
as a Unity Gizmo.

[code]
----
void OnDrawGizmos()
{
    Gizmos.color = Color.blue;
    Gizmos.DrawLineStrip(curve, false);

    foreach (Vector3 p in ctrlpts)
    {
        Gizmos.DrawSphere(p, 0.2f);
    }

}

== IK Controllers

We will implement two controllers, one for the head (or eyes, antenna, of whatever makes sense for your 
character) and one for a two-link limb. 

=== Gaze Controller

The gaze controller will track a target with your character's head (or eyes or
antenna, depending on your character).  The gaze controller will use our
relative rotation formulation based on tangent to update the orientation of
the head. Recall that the angle of rotation is as follows.

[stem]
++++
phi = \text{atan2}(||r \times e||, r \cdot r + r \cdot e)
++++

And the axis of rotation is stem:[(r \times e)/||r \times e||]

Requirements

* Write a script, `Scripts/GazeController.cs`, that is a component for the root of your player character.
* Your script should take a Transform parameter to serve as your target
* Your script should take a Transform parameter that indicates the joint of your character that should point towards the target. In the example below, the *nose* joint points towards the target from the head.
* In Update(), implement the calculation that points the head to the target
* Use Debug.DrawLine to visualize the line between the head joint and the target

Tips for computing the rotation

* Use _global coordinates_ to compute the rotation axis and angle. Use Quaternion.AngleAxis to compute the final rotation.
* The computed rotation should be set on the _parent_ joint. For example, if I want to point the nose towards the target, I must set the rotation on the head (which is the parent joint of the nose)
* The computed rotation is a _relative rotation_, so you should multiply it to the current rotation, e.g., `lookJoint.parent.rotation = computedRot * lookJoint.parent.rotation` 


=== Two-Link Controller

The two-link controller will track a target using the two-link IK formulation from 
class. 

* Write a script, `Scripts/TwoLinkController.cs`, that is a component for the root of your player character.
* Your script should take a Transform parameter to serve as your target
* Your script should take a Transform parameter that indicates the end effector of your character
** The end effector's parent will be the middle hinge joint (like the "elbow" from class)
** The end effector's grandparent will be the ball joint (like the "shoulder" from class)
* In Update(), implement the calculation that places the end effector on the target
* Use Debug.DrawLine to visualize the bend axis 
* Calculate the distance between the grandparent and end effector and check if it matches the distance between the grandparent joint and the target.
