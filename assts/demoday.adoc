**Due in lab, Nov 19**

The goals for the demo:

* Create a complete experience that is playable by someone elements
* Get feedback on your work
* Demonstrate improvements to your original assignment submissions

= Demo

Your demo should have the following working features, combined in a single scene:

* Controllable player character with animations (that you've setup yourself)
* Collection mechanic with UI and animated pickup effect
* Two NPCs with unique behaviors

Demo Day counts as a bonus assignment that will improve one's homework score.
