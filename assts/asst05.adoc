**Due Friday, October 4, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Implement simple player controls 
* Implement a spring follow camera that follows the player
* (Optional) Use transparency to prevent objects from obscuring the camera

:sectnums:

= Getting Started

It is not necessary to fetch from the upstream repository this week. Instead, 

* Create a new scene, called `A05_Player`, and save it to your `HelloUnity/Assets/Scenes` folder.

**Scene and Player Setup**

* Initialize your scene with the prefab containing your level from assignments 3 and 4
* Add your character from assignment 4. After completing this assignment, we recommend you create a prefab for your character and camera. 

= Assignment Goals

The primary goal of this assignment is to implement a character that represents
your player. We will implement a third-person character with a spring follow
camera. You should also implement a feature that makes objects that block the character transparent. 
Next week, we will add animation to your character. Thus, the features needed for this week are:

* WASD keys for controlling the movement of the character forward, left, down, and right respectively 
* Mouse movement should control the preferred heading and pitch of the camera. Pressing the spacebar should reset the camera behind the character.

== Player controls

Write a script, `Scripts/PlayerControls.cs`, that is a component for the root of the player character.

* The keyboard keys WASD should move the player forward/back/left/right relative to its current position
* Add two parameters to your script to control the linear speed and turning speed of the character

The algorithm should look something like this in Update()
[source]
----
if the player pressed the W key
   Move forward
else if the player pressed the S key
   Move backward
else if the player presses the A key
   Turn left
else if the player presses the D key
   Turn right
----

Some questions to think about when you implement this feature:

* How can we get the forward and up directions of a GameObject in Unity?
* How can we set parameters in a script so that we can give them values in the Unity IDE?
* How can we use time to ensure the player moves smoothly?
* In Unity, how can you specify a rotation around the Y axis?
* When we translate the player we add a displacement. How do we "add", or concatenate, a rotation to the player?

== Third person camera

We will complete this feature in two steps. First, we will implement a rigid
camera, however, _using a script_ and *not* be parenting the camera under the player object.

=== Rigid follow camera

Write a script, `Scripts/RigidFollowCamera.cs`, that is a component for a camera object. 
Below are requirements and hints: 

* Give RigidFollowCamera.cs a `public Transform target` parameter that is set to the player 
* Give RigidFollowCamera.cs parameters to represent the desired horizontal and vertical distances from the center of the player character

The algorithm for a basic follow camera is as follows (Madhav Chapter 8). Implement the following 
in LateUpdate() for a smoother result.

[source]
----
// tPos, tUp, tForward = Position, up, and forward vector of target
// hDist = horizontal follow distance
// vDist = vertical follow distance

// Camera position is offset from the target position
Vector3 eye = tPos - tForward * hDist + tUp * vDist

// The direction the camera should point is from the target to the camera position
Vector3 cameraForward = tPos - eye

// Set the camera's position and rotation with the new values
// This code assumes that this code runs in a script attached to the camera
transform.position = eye;
transform.rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(cameraForward);
----

Some questions to think about when you implement this feature:

* How can we get the forward and up directions of a GameObject in Unity?
* How can we set parameters in a script so that we can give them values in the Unity IDE?

=== Spring follow camera

Write a script, `Scripts/SpringFollowCamera.cs`, that is a component for a camera object. 
Your Spring Follow Camera will support the same controls as the rigid camera; however, instead 
of rigidly following the player character, we will gently and smoothly follow the player using 
spring dynamics. The requirements and hints are be the same as before. 

* Give SpringFollowCamera.cs a `public Transform target` parameter that is set to the player 
* Give SpringFollowCamera.cs parameters to represent the 
** desired horizontal distance
** desired vertical distance
** the dampening factor, `dampConstant`
** the spring constant, `springConstant` 

The algorithm for a basic spring follow camera is as follows (Madhav Chapter 8). Implement this 
in LateUpdate() for smoother animation.

[source]
----
// tPos, tUp, tForward = Position, up, and forward vector of target
// hDist = horizontal follow distance
// vDist = vertical follow distance

// Camera position is offset from the target position
Vector3 idealEye = tPos - tForward * hDist + tUp * vDist

// The direction the camera should point is from the target to the camera position
Vector3 cameraForward = tPos - actualPosition

// Compute the acceleration of the spring, and then integrate
Vector3 displacement = actualPosition - idealEye
Vector3 springAccel = (-springConstant * displacement) - (dampConstant * velocity)

// Update the camera's velocity based on the spring acceleration
velocity += springAccel * deltaTime
actualPosition += velocity * deltaTime

// Set the camera's position and rotation with the new values
// This code assumes that this code runs in a script attached to the camera
transform.position = actualPosition;
transform.rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(cameraForward);

//=== Handling obstacles in the view
//
//We never want the player's view of the game world to become blocked by geometry in the scene. 
//Implement a feature to make blocking geometry transparent. The algorithm for doing so looks like 
//
//[source]
//----
//Perform a segment raycast between the camera and the player
//If the raycast intercepts an object, change the object's material so it is transparent
//If an object is not blocking the view but was before, revert its material to its previous transparency
//----
//
//Use the Unity function link:https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.RaycastAll.html[Raycast.RaycastAll] 
//to find intercepting objects. See the raycast page for sample code that changes transparency.
//
//[source]
//----
//float rayLength = 100.0F; // careful: use the distance between character and the camera
//RaycastHit[] hits = Physics.RaycastAll(transform.position, transform.forward, rayLength);
//----
