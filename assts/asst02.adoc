**Due Friday, September 13, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Write a progam in C#
* Implement a simple game based on the Game Loop and Object Update patterns

:sectnums:

The goal of this assignment is to write a C# Game that utilizes a game loop, game time, 
and the object update pattern. You can design any game you like, but choose something 
that you can implement in a few days. Your game should also support some kind of interaction 
with the player. Below is an example that fullfills these requirements:

video::A02-Arcade-Images.mp4[width=512]

The above video uses the WASD or arrow keys to control the player (pink squiggle). 
The black and white squiggles are randomly created obstacles that float from right 
to left. Both the player and obstacles implement the Update pattern. The game loop is 
implemented in the main Window (given as part of your basecode).

You are given basecode for implementing a 2D game; however, you can also 
write a text-based game that fullfills the requirements if you prefer.
The final game should be a 2-5 minute experience that another person can 
eaily understand and try. 

NOTE: You may use an existing game that you have already written,  for example
a homework from intro or from your own tinkering, and port it to C#. Your game
should be something that you have written!

NOTE: This assignment does not use Unity!

= Requirements

* You must define at least one class that has an `Update(dt)` method and implements something that must be simulated over time.
* Your program must take some kind of player input (e.g. is must be interactive)
* Your program must implement a game loop. If you implement a 2D game, the game loop is implemented for you in your basecode. 

= Getting Started

First sync your fork with the class respository. This can be done from Github

Once synced, you can then pull the changes to your local repository where you will work 
using Git Bash:

```
alinen@sutekh MINGW64 ~/cs283-f24-assignments-test (main)
$ git pull
Enter passphrase for key '/c/Users/alinen/.ssh/id_ed25519':

== Compiling and Running 

The C# compiler can be run from Visual Studio 2022. Under File -> Open -> Folder, browse to 
the directory that contains your code (cs283-f24-assignments/C#Game). 

Inside Visual Studio, build and run from the developer console like so

```
$ csc *.cs
$ .\Window.exe
```

You should see an empty window.

NOTE: You can enable developer powershell in Visual Studio from the menu. Select `View -> Terminal`

= Program Architecture

You are given basecode for this assignment. 
Read through the class `Window.cs`. This class registers callbacks on user input (mouse and keyboard), 
drawing, and update. This class also implements the game loop and computes delta time. 

Your code should be implemented in the class `Game.cs`. `Game.cs` is integrated with the `Window` class.

* `Game.Setup()` is called once before the game loop starts
* `Game.Update(float dt)` is called once per frame with the elapsed time in seconds
* `Game.Draw(Graphics g)` is called when the window is refreshed 
* `Game.MouseClick(e)` is called when the user clicks a mouse button. See the `Game.cs` for an example of how to use it.
* `Game.KeyDown(e)` is called when the user clicks presses the keyboard. See the `Game.cs` code for an example of how to use it.

== Example

This section describes how the example game was made. The game uses three classes:

* `Game.cs` which creates the objects, responds to input, and manages whether the game is over or not
* `Obstacle.cs` which implements moving Obstacles
* `Player.cs` which implements the Player which moves based on input

The game creates an array of `Obstacle` and one `Player`. In Update, the game updates the obstacles and the player. 
In Draw, the game draws the obstacles and the player. Both `Obstacle` and `Player` implement the following methods

* Reset()
* Draw(Graphics g)
* Update(float dt)

Thus, updating and drawing simply calls these functions on the player and every obstacle. 
For example, the code to update all game objects in `Game.cs` looks like

```
foreach (Obstacle obstacle in _obstacles)
{
    obstacle.Update(dt);
}
player.Update(dt);
```

Drawing is handled similarly. For the player, we implemented methods called
`MoveUp`, `MoveLeft`, etc.  When the user pressed a movement key, we call the
associated method. These methods change the direction that the player moves in
Update.

= Drawing Tips

For convenience, we are using the command in link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.graphics?view=net-8.0[`System.Drawing`] for this assignment. 
This module supports drawing simple primitives (rectangles, circles, lines, etc), text, and images. Here are some examples
Every draw call requires the a reference to the `Graphics` object that is passed to Draw. 

Draw text that is centered in the middle of the screen
```
public void Draw(Graphics g)
{
   Font font = new Font("Arial", 46);
   SolidBrush fontBrush = new SolidBrush(Color.White);

   StringFormat format = new StringFormat();
   format.LineAlignment = StringAlignment.Center;
   format.Alignment = StringAlignment.Center;

   g.DrawString("GAME OVER!", font, fontBrush, 
      (float) (Window.width * 0.5), 
      (float) (Window.height * 0.5), 
      format);
}
```

Draw a circle
```
public void Draw(Graphics g)
{
    Color c = Color.FromArgb(100, 250, 0, 0); // red 
    Brush brush = new SolidBrush(c);
    g.FillEllipse(brush, X, Y, Size, Size);
}
```

Draw a rectangle that fills the window
```
public void Draw(Graphics g)
{
{
    Color background = ColorTranslator.FromHtml("#142F98");
    Brush brush = new SolidBrush(background);
    g.FillRectangle(brush, 1, 1, Window.width, Window.height);
}
```

Draw an image
```
Image mImg = Image.FromFile("filename.png"); // load once during initialization

...
public void Draw(Graphics g)
{
   g.DrawImage(mImg, x, y, width, height);
}
```

= Ideas

Any simple game could form a good basis for this assignment, for example, 

* Frogger
* Neko Atsumi
* Galaga
* Asteroids

= What to hand in

* Your code
* Updated README
** A video or GIF showing your game play 
** Instructions on how to play, e.g. the game controls
** Instructions on how to build
