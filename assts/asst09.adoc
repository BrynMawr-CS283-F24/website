**Due Friday, November 8, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Implement A* path planning
* Implement a wander behavior

:sectnums:

= Getting Started

It is not necessary to fetch from the upstream repository this week. Instead, 

* Create a new scene, called `A09_Path`, and save it to your `HelloUnity/Assets/Scenes` folder.

**Scene and Player Setup**

In both your scenes:

* Initialize your scene with the prefab containing your level from assignment 7. 
* Add your character from assignment 4. 

= Assignment Goals

This assignment has one part. You will implement A* path planning and use it to 
implement a simple wander behavior for non-player characters. In our demo, we use 
the same character with different textures to distinguish between the player 
and other characters, but you can choose your own approach.

== A* Path Planning

* Write a script, `Scripts/PathPlanner.cs`, that is a component for the root of a character.

You can re-use the path following script from assignment 6.

== Wander behavior

* Write a script, `Scripts/Wander.cs`, that is a component for the root of a character.

= What to hand in

* Your scenes with your level and player in it
* Your scripts, ``
* Updated README
** A video or GIF showing the motion controller, intersections with the world, and collection mechanic
** Credits/links for any assets that you did not make yourself -- if you add assets this week.
