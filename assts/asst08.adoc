* Implement a simple collection mechanic with user interface

= Getting Started

It is not necessary to fetch from the upstream repository this week. Instead, 

* Create a new scene, called `A08_Collection`, and save it to your `HelloUnity/Assets/Scenes` folder.

**Scene and Player Setup**

In both your scenes:

* Initialize your scene with the prefab containing your level from assignment 7.
* Add your character from assignment 4. 

IMPORTANT: Be sure to remove any animation components from your character. In this assignment, you should create your own. 

= Assignment Goals

This assignment has two parts. In the first part, you will setup a motion controller with parameters for your 
character. If your character already has one setup, you should remove it and create a simple controller for this 
assignment. In the second part, you will setup colliders so that the player does not intersect objects and can 
collect objects in the scene. 

== Motion controller

* Write a script, `Scripts/PlayerMotionController.cs`, that is a component for the root of your player character.

In class, we talked about how to setup a motion controller for a character. Your character will need animations associated with it. Reach out to us if your character 
does not have animations, or you are unsure, so we can help you. 

== Collision volumes

== Collection mechanic

= What to hand in

* Your scenes with your level and player in it
* Your scripts, ``
* Updated README
** A video or GIF showing the motion controller, intersections with the world, and collection mechanic
** Credits/links for any assets that you did not make yourself -- if you add assets this week.
