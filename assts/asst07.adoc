**Due Friday, October 25, before midnight**

The goals for this assignment are:

* Implement a simple motion controller for your character 
* Support collisions and gravity for your character

:sectnums:

= Getting Started

It is not necessary to fetch from the upstream repository this week. Instead, 

* Create a new scene, called `A07_Motion`, and save it to your `HelloUnity/Assets/Scenes` folder.

**Scene and Player Setup**

In both your scenes:

* Initialize your scene with the prefab containing your level from assignments 3 and 4
* Add your character from assignment 4. 

IMPORTANT: Be sure to remove any animation components from your character. In this assignment, you should create your own. 

= Assignment Goals

This assignment has two parts. In the first part, you will setup a motion controller with parameters for your 
character. If your character already has one setup, you should remove it and create a simple controller for this 
assignment. In the second part, you will setup colliders so that the player does not intersect objects and can 
collect objects in the scene. 

== Motion controller

We will now implement features to animate our player character using Unity's Mechanim system to 
create a state machine for transitioning between different animation clips. This feature requires 
your player asset to contain animation clips. If you are unsure whether your character has animation 
clips, we can help you. The demo below shows the goal of this feature.

This feature has two parts. First, you must configure your player character with an Animator and 
AnimatorComponent. Second, you must write a script, `Scripts/PlayerMotionController.cs`, that is 
a component for the root of your player character and that triggers animation transitions.

For the first part, you must configure your player character to have animations. The configuration 
for our cat character is below. For resources on setting up your character, see the advice below.

For the second part, use your script, `Scripts/PlayerControls.cs`, from
assignment 5 as a starting point and add code to change the animation based on
the velocity of the player. When the player is moving, show a walk or run
animation. When the player is stationary, show and idle animation. See the advice below 
for Unity API documentation for implementing this feature.

Requirements:

* Create a motion controller that has at least two states for idling and moving. 
* Create parameters on your motion controller.
* Do not use a prefab your motion controller. You must make your own.

Animator Setup Advice:

Use the Unity documentation to learn how to setup a motion controller for your
character.  First, you should look at your character in the asset window and see
what link:https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationClips.html[animation clips]
it has on it. You can also configure a
link:https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AvatarCreationandSetup.html[humanoid
avatar] if it is appropriate. Otherwise, choose "create from this model" for the
avatar type (under rig). Second, you should add an 
link:https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Animator.html[Animator component] and
add a new link:https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AnimatorController.html[Animator Controller]. 
With the animator controller, you can
add animations and setup transitions between them that use parameters. Last, you
should add a script that switches between animations. 

* Read the link:https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationOverview.html[Mechanim documentation]
* Add an link:https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Animator.html[Animator]
* Setup the link:https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-AnimatorController.html[Animator Controller]

Resources for implementing `PlayerMotionController.cs`:

* Write a script that connects the animator controller to user input.

== Physics

We now have an animated player character. But the character has no physics
behaviors: it can passthrough solid objects and doesn't respond to gravity.

We will use Unity's link:https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-CharacterController.html[CharacterController] 
component to implement these features. 

image::A07-Colliders.gif[width=640px]

Above, we put a CharacterController component on our player and extended our script,
`PlayerMotionController.cs` to call `Move` with the velocity instead of setting the position directly.

[code]
----
//transform.position = transform.position + Time.deltaTime * velocity;
CharacterController controller = GetComponent<CharacterController>();
controller.Move(velocity * Time.deltaTime);
----

Requirements:

* Put a character controller on your character
* Create Colliders on solid objects of your scene (if they do not have colliders on them already)
* Update `PlayerMotionController.cs` to move using the character controller, rather than moving the character directly. To start, change the code in `PlayerControls` where you set `transform.position` to call `Move` on your CharacterController component instead.
* Save you configured player character as a prefab
* (Optional) implement a character jump

= What to hand in

* Your scenes with your level and player in it
* Your script, `PlayerMotionController.cs`
* Updated README
** A video or GIF showing your animated character, intersections with the world, and jumping if you implemented it
** Credits/links for any assets that you did not make yourself -- if you add assets this week. 

Don't forget to commit your changes and then push them to Github. Using Git Bash, 
run the following command inside your `{ASST}` directory.

[source, subs="attributes"]
----
$ cd {ASST}
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Finished {ASST}"
$ git push
----

Run `git status` to check the result of the previous git command.
Check the Github website to make sure that your program uploaded correctly.
